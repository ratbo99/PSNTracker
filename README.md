a Tool to show Live Overlays for Tropyhunters

This is my messy Codebase for a Playstation Trophytracker to show live overlays in OBS. I coded it in 2021 and fixed some stuff over the years, because of api changes.
Maybe someone can make someting nice of it, since i gave no time to maintenance it.

I know, there are Bugs, no Localisation and stuff like this, but it works.
