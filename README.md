# PSNTracker
a Tool to show Live Overlays for Tropyhunters

This is my messy Codebase for a Playstation Trophytracker to show live overlays in OBS. I coded it in 2021 and fixed some stuff over the years, because of api changes.
Maybe someone can make something nice of it, since i have no time to maintenance it.

I know, there are Bugs, no Localisation and stuff like this, but it works.

Use:
- stert server.js (install modules first)
- close terminal > edit config file > insert npsso token & psnid > save
- start again
- load http://localhost/psn
